# App made during the programming event NLW promotted by Rocketseat
- I've stuying react + ts + nextjs during the week release of the event
# The App was mainly done using: 
  - React with Typescript
  - React Context instead of Redux, for simplification
  - NextJS doing the deploy on Vercel
### After finishing this App, i've finished another old project, a simple evangelion card generator that is available <a href="https://github.com/Lukasdias/evangelion-card-reactjs" target="_blank">here</a> using the concepts learned here.
